    <div class="main-heading">Privacy Policy for DairyTrack</div>
    <div class="effective-date">Effective Date: August 26, 2025</div>

      <strong>App Information:</strong><br>
      Package ID: com.dairytrack.app<br>
      Version: 1.0.0+4<br>
      App Type: Dairy Management System
    </div>
    
    <div class="sub-heading">Information We Collect</div>
    <p>When you use DairyTrack, we collect information necessary to provide dairy management services including your login credentials for user authentication, customer information such as names, contact details and addresses for customer management, phone numbers to enable direct calling functionality, and business data including routes, milk quantities, and financial records for billing and payment tracking.</p>
    <p>We also collect data related to your dairy operations such as milk pricing information, payment histories, business reports and analytics, and user preferences for app customization.</p>
    
    <div class="sub-heading">How We Use Your Information</div>
    <p>We use your information to provide core dairy management features including customer profile management, billing system operations, route organization, business reporting and analytics, user dashboard functionality, and app settings management for milk pricing and security preferences.</p>
    <p>Your data enables personalized dairy business management, secure user authentication, direct customer communication through phone calls, financial tracking and reporting, WhatsApp communication via URL launcher, and seamless data synchronization across your devices.</p>
    <p>We may send you essential communications related to app functionality, billing notifications, and important updates. No promotional or marketing communications are sent.</p>
    
    <div class="sub-heading">Information Sharing and Third-Party Services</div>
    <p>DairyTrack uses minimal third-party services to enhance functionality. We use Google Fonts for app typography and URL launcher functionality to open WhatsApp for customer communication when you choose to message customers.</p>
    <p>When you use the WhatsApp communication feature, the app launches WhatsApp on your device with the customer's phone number. No customer data is directly shared with WhatsApp - the integration simply opens the WhatsApp application with the phone number populated. Your actual communication with customers happens within WhatsApp according to their privacy policy.</p>
    <p>Your business data is transmitted to our secure API server for synchronization and backup purposes. We do not use analytics or tracking services that collect personal information for third parties.</p>
    
    <div class="sub-heading">Data Storage and Security</div>
    <p>Your data is stored both locally on your device using Flutter Secure Storage and Shared Preferences for quick access and offline functionality, and remotely on our secure API servers for backup and synchronization across devices.</p>
    <p>We implement industry-standard security measures including local data encryption through secure storage, encrypted transmission to our servers, and access controls to protect your sensitive dairy business information including customer data, financial records, and business analytics.</p>
    
    <div class="sub-heading">App Permissions</div>
    <p>DairyTrack requests specific device permissions to function properly. Internet access is required for API communication and data synchronization. Phone call permission enables direct calling to customers from within the app. Network state access helps manage connectivity and ensure reliable data transmission.</p>
    <p>All permissions are used solely for their intended dairy management functions and we do not access any information beyond what is necessary for these features to operate.</p>
    
    <div class="sub-heading">Data Retention</div>
    <p>We retain your information for as long as your account is active and as necessary to provide dairy management services. Business records including customer information, billing data, and financial records may be retained longer as required by business and agricultural regulations.</p>
    <p>You can request deletion of your account and associated data at any time, subject to legal retention requirements for business records.</p>
    
    <div class="sub-heading">Your Rights and Choices</div>
    <p>You have the right to access, correct, export, or delete your personal data through the app settings or by contacting us directly. You can manage customer information, update business details, and control app preferences within the application.</p>
    <p>You may disable certain features such as WhatsApp integration or phone calling functionality, though this may limit some app capabilities. You can delete your account and request data removal at any time.</p>
    
    <div class="sub-heading">No Analytics or Advertising</div>
    <p>DairyTrack does not use analytics services that track personal behavior or collect data for advertising purposes. We do not display advertisements or share your information with advertising networks.</p>
    <p>Our focus is solely on providing dairy management functionality without compromising your privacy through unnecessary data collection or third-party tracking.</p>
    
    <div class="sub-heading">Updates to This Privacy Policy</div>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices, app features, or legal requirements. We will notify you of significant changes through the app or via email.</p>
    <p>Continued use of DairyTrack after changes implies your acceptance of the updated policy. We encourage you to review this policy regularly.</p>
    
    <div class="sub-heading">Contact Us</div>
    <p>If you have questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or your data, please contact us at <a href="mailto:muhammedswalih476@gmail.com">muhammedswalih476@gmail.com</a>.</p>
    <p>We are committed to addressing your privacy concerns promptly and transparently.</p>
